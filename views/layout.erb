        <h2>Current Status: Working on it!</h2>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Twitter has established itself as a dominant force in the online social networking movement. The majority of users use Twitter to maintain their profile and update statuses which has the side effect of creating big data. Useful data can often be extracted from big data.</p>
      <p>However, Twitter does not lend itself to the typical data representation that is used by traditional search engines such as Google and as thus these copycat search engines adapted for Twitter do not display results in the best way possible considering the different key characteristics of Twitter's data.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Search Twitter?</h3>
      <p>There are many reasons someone may want to search through the vast array of tweets, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time results</li>
        <li>Trend spotting for marketing purposes</li>
        <li>Personal responses to real-world events</li>
        <li>Find interesting people or friends</li>
        <li>Find opinions of certain authors</li>
        <li>Find all tweets corresponding to a hashtag</li>
        <li>Use it as a daily news source</li>
      </ul>
